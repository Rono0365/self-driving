Self-Driving Software for Game
This software is a self-driving program software. The program is designed to simulate an autonomous vehicle that can navigate through the game environment without any human intervention.

Requirements
The software has been developed using Python 3. It requires the following dependencies:

Pygame (v1.9.6 or higher)
OpenCV (v4.5.3 or higher)
Numpy (v1.20.3 or higher)
Matplotlib (v3.3.4 or higher)
These dependencies can be installed using pip, as follows:


pip install pygame opencv-python numpy matplotlib
Usage
To run the self-driving program, execute the following command:



python main.py
This will start the game and the self-driving program. The program will attempt to navigate the vehicle through the game environment, avoiding obstacles and staying on the track.

Configuration
The self-driving program can be configured using the config.py file. This file contains various parameters that control the behavior of the program, including the speed of the vehicle, the range of the sensors, and the algorithm used for steering.
